# Experiments

This section of the repository contains the code used for various experiments, including data aggregation, results analysis, and simulations involving AI agents.

## Contents

The code is organized into two main directories: Analysis and Simulations.

### Simulations
- `Simulations/AI_Agents_Simulation_Main.ipynb`: This notebook simulates conversations with AI agents to evaluate their responses and behaviors under standard conditions.
- `Simulations/AI_Agents_Simulation_Paid.ipynb`: Similar to the main simulation notebook but focuses on conversations and experiments involving paid questions, adding a layer of complexity to the interactions.
