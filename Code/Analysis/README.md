# Experiments

This section of the repository contains the code used for various experiments, including data aggregation, results analysis, and simulations involving AI agents.

## Contents

The code is organized into two main directories: Analysis and Simulations.

### Analysis
- `Analysis/Results-aggregation.py`: This script aggregates datasets from multiple sources, preparing them for further analysis.
- `Analysis/Ai_Agents_Results_Analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that provides detailed analysis of the aggregated results, focusing on the performance and outcomes of AI agents.
